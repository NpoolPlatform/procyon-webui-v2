    <h3>Aleo GOLD - Earn Aleo tokens before the mainnet launches!</h3>

    <p>Aleo’s Prover Incentive program is over, which means Procyon users can now buy Aleo Gold</p>

    <p><strong>Aleo still has 17.5 million testnet credits that need to be distributed</strong>. We expect the next incentive program to be announced for testnet verifiers: stay tuned for updates!</p>

    <p>Procyon’s Aleo Platinum earned early rewards for early buyers. <strong>If you haven’t yet bought this first-batch mining, don’t miss this next chance!</strong></p>

    <p>These testnet incentives are eligible for partial conversion to mainnet Aleo tokens, and our partner Hpool continues to participate for all of our Aleo buyers.</p>

    <h3>Procyon’s Project Selection</h3>

    <p>Procyon selects projects for a number of reasons, so here are a few of the most important:</p>

    <div class='info-table-container table-2-columns'>
      <table class='info-table'>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th id='aqua'>
              <span>Good Projects</span>
            </th>
            <th id='pink'>
              <span>Scam Projects</span>
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Produce great innovations</td>
            <td>Add no value to the industry</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Are more public about their code and progress</td>
            <td>Hide code and keep quiet</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Clearly communicate the token distribution, future road map, and backers</td>

      </table>
    </div>

    <h3>First Batch Mining and its Advantages</h3>

    <p>In addition to filtering for great projects, Procyon selects for early opportunities to generate the best value for our users. Therefore, we prioritize first batch mining:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Timing is important: mining is most profitable from the first day of mainnet launch.</li>
      <li>Why is the first day the most profitable? There are fewer miners participating, hence more rewards to be distributed per miner.</li>
      <li>Mining projects see a rapid increase in the number of miners in the first three months: it is essential to start early.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why is Aleo Essential to Web3?</h3>

    <p><img class='project-promo-content' src='product/aleo/aleo-web3-en.png'></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Web1 was about making information searchable &amp; exchangeable. Google was the big winner.</li>
      <li>Web2 was about platforms and gave us Facebook, but value only flowed through these massive platforms.</li>
      <li>Web3 is about ownership: users are capturing value themselves! Web3 is the next evolutionary step of the internet!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since the creation of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, privacy has been one of the biggest unresolved issues. This industry has pioneered transparency and decentralization, solving big problems at which centralized banking has so far failed.</p>

    <p>However, a great deal of time has gone by, and the next big problem that needs to be solved is privacy. The less privacy someone has the more vulnerable they are to people with bad agendas. It’s equivalent to "Do you want people to know your home address?" "Do you want people to know how much money you have in your bank account?"</p>

    <p>Projects such as Aleo will spearhead the solution to privacy on blockchain.</p>

    <h3>Why is Aleo Special?</h3>

    <h4>Aleo is the first Layer1 blockchain for fully decentralized private applications.</h4>

    <p><img class='project-promo-content' src='product/aleo/aleo-privacy-prog-en.png'></p>

    <p>Most blockchains either prioritize programmability at the expense of privacy or the other way around. So far, no project has been able to offer both. Aleo is the key to scaling Web3 and opening up real use cases with programmable privacy.</p>

    <p>Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Aleo can anonymize payments, NFT, dApps, gaming, and more. Zero-Knowledge Proofs will be woven into the fabric of the internet, eliminating a trade-off: one’s privacy for the right to operate online.</p>

    <h3>Which VC Firms Invest in Aleo?</h3>

    <p>The funding stands as the largest fundraising round ever in the zero-knowledge industry. <a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/search/principal.investors/field/organizations/num_investors/aleo-673f' target='_blank'>Backers include SoftBank, Coinbase, a16z, and over 19 other world-class investors.</a></p>

    <p>Investors have high hopes for Aleo to deliver on its mission of a fully private Web3 experience. Some Ethereum-based projects use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to solve Ethereum’s scalability issue. Aleo, on the other hand, has developed its own Layer 1 blockchain that significantly improves both scalability and privacy. According to a16z, "Aleo uses a new computation system called Zexe, that is entirely private and that scales far beyond most blockchains that are live today."</p>

    <h3>Aleo Team</h3>

    <p>Aleo is built by a stellar team! The company was officially launched in 2019 by Howard Wu, Michael Beller, Collin Chin and Raymond Chu. Aleo’s team contains the world's top cryptographers, engineers, designers and operators from companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, as well as from research universities such as Standford, UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins, New York University and Cornell University.</p>

    <h3>Project Roadmap</h3>

    <p><img class='project-promo-content' src='product/aleo/aleo-roadmap-en.png'></p>

    <h3>Media Coverage</h3>

    <h4>Aleo is a hot topic!</h4>

    <p><a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-03-08/aleo-and-forte-partner-to-power-the-next-generation-of-gaming-economics' target='_blank'>Bloomberg reports</a> that Aleo announced a partnership with The Forte Platform, which is most well-known for Zynga, the creator of some of the biggest mobile games like the FarmVille series, to introduce blockchain-based digital property rights – NFTs and game tokens – to their games. Forte will be leveraging Aleo’s privacy technology to build MMORPGs with fog of war features. The NFTs and application will start adoption after the mainnet.</p>

    <p><a href='https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zero-knowledge-cryptography-in-2023%3A-the-year-privacy-becomes-practical' target='_blank'>Featured on Nasdaq</a>, a <a href='https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/29/zero-knowledge-cryptography-in-2023-the-year-privacy-becomes-practical/' target='_blank'>CoinDesk article by Aleo’s CEO Alex Pruden</a> describes 4 impacts of this important technology:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ZK-powered layer 1 smart-contract blockchain chain will launch.</li>
      <li>Rollups will remain centralized, and zkEVMs will remain impractical.</li>
      <li>Hardware acceleration will make ZK more practical, useful and accessible across the board.</li>
      <li>Companies will have to choose a side on privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href='https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-aleo-crypto-coin-may-give-gpu-miners-a-second-chance' target='_blank'>Tom’s Hardware reports</a> that many ETH mining pools are shifting over to Aleo testnet mining.</p>

            <td>Exchanges will check if the project has a big and active community to guarantee a large customer base.</td>
            <td class='table-highlight'>
              Thanks to the credibility of its technology and team, Aleo has amassed 70k twitter followers and healthy activity in its other social media channels (Telegram, Discord, AMAs, etc).

    <h3 id='Aleo Prover Incentive Program'>
      Aleo Prover Incentive Program
    </h3>

    <p>Since December 2nd, 2022, <a href='https://www.aleo.org/post/testnet-3-incentives-kickoff' target='_blank'>Aleo has implemented "Prover Incentives"</a> for its testnet participants. Aleo credits that are mined during this phase of the testnet will become redeemable for Aleo mainnet tokens at a 5:1 ratio (20%) upon mainnet launch. To put it simply, Aleo first-batch mining is already generating tokens even before mainnet launch!</p>

    <h4>Aleo incentives program — how it works:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Aleo has set aside 25 million Aleo credits for Testnet 3 incentives. The initial part of the Aleo Incentives program will be focused on Provers. Prover Incentives account for <strong>7.5 million credits (30% of 25 million total Aleo credits)</strong>.</li>
      <li>At mainnet launch, <strong>Aleo credits will be redeemable at a rate of 5:1 (20%)</strong>. A bonus for first-batch miners!</li>
      <li>Aleo credits to be redeemed for Aleo tokens at a ratio of 5:1 upon mainnet launch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Again, the 5:1 ratio refers to the fact that 20% of Aleo testnet rewards can be redeemed for Aleo tokens upon mainnet launch. Testnet rewards can be earned by participating in the Testnet Prover Incentive Program.</p>

    <p><strong>e.g. if 1 unit mines 100 testnet rewards, they will be eligible to receive 20 Aleo tokens upon mainnet launch.</strong></p>

    <p>The Aleo testnet reward is a significant step towards its mainnet launch.</p>

    <h3>Risk warning and disclaimer: cryptocurrencies involve risk.</h3>

    <p>First of all, Procyon and its team will make best efforts for its users.</p>

    <p>That said, as a general rule, one should only select products that they are familiar with and understand the risk associated with them. Value of such products may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, such as changes in government policies, economic conditions, or market trends. Further, such products are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant overseas jurisdiction in which these products are held. Lastly, if one undertakes transactions on an online platform, they may be exposed to risks associated with the system including the unpredictable failure of hardware and software due to circumstances outside of our control.</p>
