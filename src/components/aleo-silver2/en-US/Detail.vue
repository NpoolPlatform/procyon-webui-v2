    <h3>Why is Aleo Essential to Web3?</h3>

    <p><img class='project-promo-content' src='product/aleo/aleo-web3-en.png'></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web1 was about information.</strong> Google was the big winner.</li>
      <li><strong>Web2 was about platforms</strong> and gave us Facebook and Amazon. But value flowed through platforms and all user information was owned by centralized organizations.</li>
      <li><strong>Web3 is about ownership</strong>: you are capturing value yourselves! You own your own money, data, and online activity. Web3 is the next evolutionary step of the internet!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While Web3 allows for self-ownership, the technology of blockchain allows for your information viewed publicly on the distributed ledger. <strong>The less privacy you have, the more vulnerable you are to people who have a bad agenda.</strong> It’s equivalent to “Do you want people to know your home address?” “Do you want people to know how much money you have in your bank account?”</p>

    <h3>Why is Aleo Special?</h3>

    <h4>Aleo is the first Layer1 blockchain for fully decentralized private applications.</h4>

    <p><img class='project-promo-content' src='product/aleo/aleo-privacy-prog-en.png'></p>

    <p>Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Aleo can privatize payments, digital identity, NFTs, dApps, gaming, and more. Zero-Knowledge Proofs will be woven into the fabric of the internet, eliminating a trade-off: your privacy for the right to operate online.</p>

    <h4>Never before has there been a technology like Aleo.</h4>

    <p>Aleo raised approximately $298 million in just two funding rounds. The funding stands as the largest fundraising round ever in the zero-knowledge industry. <a href='https://www.crunchbase.com/search/principal.investors/field/organizations/num_investors/aleo-673f' target='_blank'>Backers include SoftBank, Coinbase, a16z, and over 19 other world-class investors.</a></p>

    <p>While Filecoin raised approximately $258 million, it took six rounds of funding to achieve. It is very rare that the Softbank Vision Fund invests in a crypto project. SoftBank Vision Fund has not only invested in Aleo, but it also serves as a member of Aleo's board of directors.</p>

    <h3>Aleo Team</h3>

    <p>Aleo is built by a stellar team! The company was officially launched in 2019 by Howard Wu, Michael Beller, Collin Chin and Raymond Chu. Aleo’s team contains the world's top cryptographers, engineers, designers and operators from companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, as well as from research universities such as Standford, UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins, New York University and Cornell University.</p>

    <h3>Media Coverage</h3>

    <h4>Aleo is a hot topic!</h4>

    <p><a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2022-03-08/aleo-and-forte-partner-to-power-the-next-generation-of-gaming-economics' target='_blank'>Bloomberg reports</a> that Aleo announced a partnership with The Forte Platform, which is most well-known for Zynga, the creator of some of the biggest mobile games like the FarmVille series, to introduce blockchain-based digital property rights – NFTs and game tokens – to their games. Forte will be leveraging Aleo’s privacy technology to build MMORPGs with fog of war features. The NFTs and application will start adoption after the mainnet.</p>

    <p><a href='https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/zero-knowledge-cryptography-in-2023%3A-the-year-privacy-becomes-practical' target='_blank'>Featured on Nasdaq</a>, a <a href='https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/29/zero-knowledge-cryptography-in-2023-the-year-privacy-becomes-practical/' target='_blank'>CoinDesk article by Aleo’s CEO Alex Pruden</a> describes 4 impacts of this important technology:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ZK-powered layer 1 smart-contract blockchain chain will launch.</li>
      <li>Rollups will remain centralized, and zkEVMs will remain impractical.</li>
      <li>Hardware acceleration will make ZK more practical, useful and accessible across the board.</li>
      <li>Companies will have to choose a side on privacy.</li>

    <p>There’s obviously opportunity and buzz around Aleo, but any early adopter wants to be sure the tokens are listed on major exchanges. Here’s how CEXs (centralized exchanges) decide:</p>

    <div class='info-table-container'>
      <table class='info-table'>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th />
            <th>What does CEX look for?</th>
            <th class='table-highlight'>
              Aleo will be listed on top exchanges because...
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Technology Innovation</strong></td>
            <td>Exchanges compare the project with its competitors to see how much value it would bring to the Web3 space, as well as the potential size of the future market.</td>
            <td class='table-highlight'>
              As a Layer1, Aleo can revolutionize the industry by letting dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and other projects thrive due to its privacy features.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Community Activity</strong></td>
            <td>Exchanges will check if the project has a big and active community to guarantee a large customer base.</td>
            <td class='table-highlight'>
              Thanks to the credibility of its technology and team, Aleo has amassed 70k twitter followers and healthy activity in its other social media channels (Telegram, Discord, AMAs, etc).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Investors (VCs)</strong></td>
            <td>Exchanges will check the investors/cap table of the project before listing. Large-scale VCs bring resources that help projects grow.</td>
            <td class='table-highlight'>
              Aleo is very well-funded. Its first funding round includes a16z, Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital; second VC round includes SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Tiger Global, Samsung Ventures.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Network Activity</strong></td>
            <td>Exchanges check how active the project’s network is. The more validators / miners, the more stable the network, resulting in higher trading volume.</td>
            <td class='table-highlight'>
              Aleo is now in its 3rd Testnet phase, with the mainnet quickly approaching. Hpool, f2pool, ZK.Work, and other massive mining pools are already deploying on Aleo.

    <h3>Procyon’s Project Selection</h3>

    <p>Procyon selects projects for a number of reasons, so here are a few of the most important:</p>

    <div class='info-table-container table-2-columns'>
      <table class='info-table'>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th id='aqua'>
              <span>Good Projects</span>
            </th>
            <th id='pink'>
              <span>Scam Projects</span>
            </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Produce great innovations</td>
            <td>Add no value to the industry</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Are more public about their code and progress</td>
            <td>Hide code and keep quiet</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Get investments from famous large institutions</td>
            <td>Do ICO and sell tokens directly to individuals before going on exchanges</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Have teams with top education, work experience from well-known enterprises, and experience in blockchain, not just crypto</td>
            <td>Do not disclose the team</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Invest time into development of its tech: always check the R&amp;D time!</td>
            <td>Launch fast and poorly</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Clearly communicate the token distribution, future road map, and backers</td>
            <td>Promise fixed returns and look like Ponzi schemes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Foster active communities</td>
            <td>Use bots and low quality conversations</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h3>First Batch Mining and its Advantages</h3>

    <p>In addition to filtering for great projects, Procyon selects for early opportunities to generate the best value for our users. Therefore, we prioritize first batch mining:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Timing is important: mining is most profitable from the first day of mainnet launch.</li>
      <li>Why is the first day the most profitable? There are fewer miners participating, hence more rewards to be distributed per miner.</li>
      <li>Mining projects see a rapid increase in the number of miners in the first three months: it is essential to start early.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk warning and disclaimer: cryptocurrencies involve risk.</h3>

    <h4>First of all, Procyon and its team will make best efforts for its users.</h4>

    <p>That said, as a general rule, one should only select products that they are familiar with and understand the risk associated with them. Value of such products may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, such as changes in government policies, economic conditions, or market trends. Further, such products are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant overseas jurisdiction in which these products are held. Lastly, if one undertakes transactions on an online platform, they may be exposed to risks associated with the system including the unpredictable failure of hardware and software due to circumstances outside of our control.</p>
