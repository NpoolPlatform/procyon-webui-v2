            Aleo Technology
          </h3>

          <h4>Aleo is the first platform to offer fully private applications.</h4>

          <p>Aleo achieves privacy by leveraging decentralized systems and zero-knowledge cryptography to protect user data on the web. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, Aleo moves smart contract execution off-chain to enable a diverse range of decentralized applications that are both entirely private and can scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second. Built on an open, public blockchain, Aleo brings all the flexibility of Ethereum but with a more scalable architecture in which miners don’t need to re-run every transaction, but simply verify their correctness.</p>

          <h3 id='Why did Procyon choose Aleo?'>
            Why did Procyon choose Aleo?
          </h3>

          <p>Aleo raised approximately $228 million in just two funding rounds, bringing its pre-listing valuation to approximately $1.45 billion. The funding stands as the largest fundraising round ever in the zero-knowledge industry.</p>

          <p>Institutional investors in Aleo include Japanese investment fund Softbank Vision, industry leader a16z, Polychain Capital, exchange Coinbase, and others who have high expectations for the project and are backing it.</p>

          <p>It is very rare that the Softbank Vision Fund invests in a crypto project. SoftBank Vision Fund has not only invested in Aleo, but it also serves as a member of Aleo's board of directors.</p>

          <p>Aleo's team is highly qualified and has a comprehensive strategy on how the service will be delivered to customers.</p>

          <p>On the technical side, Aleo offers one of the most important infrastructures of Web3’s future with its zero-knowledge proof – using ZKPs to achieve both privacy and programmability.</p>

          <p>In terms of Aleo's future ecosystem, Aleo has the potential to be the next Ethereum or Solana through its Layer 1 technology. Various applications will be developed on top of Aleo, as we have already seen with the strategic partnership with Forte - the gaming company. Aleo aims to become the solution to Web2's major drawbacks such as data leaks, private data monetization, and the permanent availability of leaked data.</p>

          <p>Our platform is invitation-only, so only selected communities will be invited to the platform. Anyone with a registered account on our platform will be able to make Aleo purchases.</p>

            When is the deadline to purchase Aleo Mining?

          <p>The Aleo First Batch Mining will close sales before mainnet launch. For latest updates, please join our Sunday Weekly Seminars.</p>

          <h3 id='Is the mainnet launch date confirmed?'>
            Is the mainnet launch date confirmed?
          </h3>

          <p>Like the majority of cryptocurrency projects, Aleo has set a roadmap for themselves and continues to push forward. As of the launch of their testnet 3, Aleo will launch when this testnet is completed. The exact launch date will fully depend on Aleo's readiness to transition to the mainnet. We will continue to update our community as we are updated. Also, please continue to stay updated by reading Aleo's twitter.</p>

          <h3 id='Why is there an extra 10% fee added when I purchase Aleo Mining with BTC?'>
            Why is there an extra 10% fee added when I purchase Aleo Mining with BTC?
          </h3>

          <p>When customers pay with BTC, we add an extra fee of about 10% to the USDT/BTC exchange rate to avoid shortfalls due to BTC price fluctuations.</p>

          <p>This is necessary to hedge the risk of BTC volatility and is not intended to make additional profit for the platform.</p>

          <p>Since we pay for all hardware and staff costs in USD, we set the price of our mining products in a stable coin (USDT).</p>

          <p>If payment are received in BTC, the BTC price may experience large fluctuations before it can be converted to USDT, which may results in singnificant losses. Therefore, we accept payments in BTC for our clients' convenience but, <strong>we encourage all buyers to make purchases with USDT</strong>.</p>

          <h3 id='' />

          <p>As of December 2nd, 2022, Aleo started the “Prover Incentives Program” for its testnet participants. This is significant news for our first-batch mining investors, as it means the Aleo credits Hpool mines during this phase of the testnet will become redeemable for Aleo tokens at a 5 to 1 ratio (20%) upon mainnet launch. In other words, your Aleo purchase is already generating ROI for you even before mainnet launch. This is official news from the Aleo team.</p>

          <h4 id='What is the Aleo Prover Incentive Program? '>
            What you need to know about the Aleo incentives program:
          </h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Aleo has set aside 25 million Aleo credits for the Testnet 3 incentives program. The initial part of the Aleo Incentives program will be focused on Provers — that’s our miners! "Prover Incentives" account for 7.5 million credits, or 30% of the 25 million total Aleo credits.</li>
            <li>The Prover Incentives period will last until January 26th, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, or until all 7.5 million credits have been mined — whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>And of course, at mainnet launch, Aleo credits will be redeemable at a rate of 5 to 1 (20%)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you purchase or have purchased our Procyon Aleo first-batch mining product before January 26th, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, or or until all 7.5 million credits have been mined, you will receive additional ROI for your investment.</p>

          <h3 id='How many testnet credits can I receive from the Aleo Prover Incentive Program? '>
            How many testnet credits can I receive from the Aleo Prover Incentive Program?
          </h3>

          <p>Because 20% of the Aleo credits generated during testnet will be redeemable, you will receive extra mining rewards on top of our simulated ROI for your investment.</p>

          <h3 id='How much hash power does one unit of Aleo First Batch Mining provide?'>
            How much hash power does one unit of Aleo First Batch Mining provide?
          </h3>

          <p>The specific hash power per unit will not be known until the main net starts. This is due to fluctuations in hash power due to machine optimization and other factors.</p>

          <p>Also, because Aleo uses GPU mining, unlike hard disk mining, hash power is not fixed even after the main network is up and running, as is the case with the above hardware. However, our mining pool partner Hpool is superior to other mining pools based on its past performance, so we expect to achieve high figures.</p>

          <p>Hpool is in the top 5 in Aleo's testnet ranking, where many well-known mining pools are competing. (as of January 26, 2023).</p>

            Can I see my mining rewards on Procyon.vip starting the day after mining starts?

            Will the mining machine stop functioning due to power outages or other problems?
          </h3>

          <p>We checked with our partner, Hpool, and they told us that there is a backup in place and that the system will not stop in the event of a power outage. We have redundancy in place for other risks as well.</p>

          <p>We will also notify you in the event of an actual power outage.</p>

            Can I see my testnet mining rewards on Procyon.vip?
          </h3>

          <p>Yes, once the testnet incentive program is over and the testnet rewards are ready for calculation,  it can be viewed on the Procyon.vip Mining Dashboard.</p>

          <p>For testnet rewards that have not yet completed the testnet incentive program, we will update all users once Aleo officials announces further details.</p>
